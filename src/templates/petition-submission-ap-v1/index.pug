      h1 Hybrid Bills

      p Hybrid Bills mix the characteristics of #[+link('http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/bills/public/', 'Public Bills')(target='_blank')]#[span.sr-only (This link will open in a new window)] and #[+link('http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/bills/private/', 'Private Bills')(target='_blank')]#[span.sr-only (This link will open in a new window)]. They often propose works of national importance in a specific area of the UK.
      
      p For example, the Channel Tunnel Bills passed in the 1970s and 1980s and the Crossrail Bill passed in 2008.

      p Changes to the law proposed by a Hybrid Bill affect the general public and impact specific individuals, groups or organisations.

      h2 Objecting to a Hybrid Bill

      p Any individual, group of individuals, organisation or group of organisations affected by a Hybrid Bill can object to it.  

      p This can lead to changes being made to the Bill, called additional provisions.

      p Objecting to additional provisions is separate to objecting to the original Bill.
